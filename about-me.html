            <div class="about-me">
                <p>I'm a dedicated bilingual educator with a love and passion for technology. 
                    For the past 17 years, I have been delivering engaging instructional lessons with integrated technology. 
                    I consider myself friendly and collaborative, offering developing skills in Web Development. 
                    Through my learning process, I discovered multiple courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React just to name a few. 
                    I instantly became captivated and excited to explore more and still have a lot more to learn.  I took the initiative to get a certification in Frontend Development with Scrimba. 
                    Web Design allows me to express my creative thoughts in a visual way. 
                    I am looking forward to a career in Frontend Development to design visually stunning, responsive and interactive websites!</p>

                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <p>I have a diverse range of interests that keep me engaged and excited every day. 
                    I love web developing, constantly exploring new technologies and creating innovative projects. 
                    Singing is another passion of mine; I find joy in expressing myself through music. 
                    I also enjoy teaching, sharing knowledge, and helping others discover their potential. 
                    And, of course, I cannot forget about FOOD! Trying new cuisines and experimenting in the kitchen is always a delight. 
                    Above all, I believe in having fun and making the most of every moment, blending my interests into a vibrant and fulfilling life!</p>
